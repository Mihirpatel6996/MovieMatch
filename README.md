## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie recommendations tailored to your tastes.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Extensive Movie Database**: Recommendations are based on a large database of movies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for developing the recommendation system.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used for creating the web interface.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit used for text processing and recommendation algorithm.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical operations.
